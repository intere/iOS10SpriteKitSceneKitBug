# iOS10SpriteKitSceneKitBug

This repo is just a proof of concept that demonstrates a bug in iOS10.  The nature of the bug has to do with embedding a SCNScene inside of a SKScene (via a SK3DNode).  The SK3DNode doesn't update unless the SK3DNode is tapped.

Checkout this repository and run the sample code to see for yourself.
